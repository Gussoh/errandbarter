# How the repository is used

Inside the /trunk folder there are two folders:
Server and Client

Server is the webbapplication, JSP web application (template from oddoneout).
Client is the MIDP-application.

_How to create the server project in Netbeans:_

  # Create new pweb application from existing sources.
  # Source location: errandbarter/server/
  # Project name/folder: whatever. I use "ErrandBarterServerProject"
  # Netbeans should automatically find web folder and WEB-INF
  # libraries is the server/lib folder
  # Source package should be errandbarter/server/src/java/


=Client=
_How to create the client project in Netbeans:_

  # Create new mobile project with existing MIDP sources.
  # Select errandbarter/client/src/ as source and it should find the JAD-file automatically.

*remember not to put any IDE-specific files inside the svn*

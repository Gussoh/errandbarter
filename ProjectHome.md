For example, if Gustav wishes to find out what are the belts and prices sold in a men's store in Orchard Road, he submits a request to the system to ask for someone to run this errand.

Daniel who is in Orchard road, may choose to help Gustav run this errand. He takes photos of the belts with his mobile phone and uploads this photo with the prices to the system. Daniel earns Barter points for this and he can use these points to barter for future errands.
